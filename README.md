**[Try it live](https://madzohan.github.io/eml-attachment-extractor/)**

## Tech Stack

- **TinyGo** â†’ compiles Go to WebAssembly
- **WASM** â†’ runs in browser without backend
- **GitHub Pages** â†’ auto-deploy on push

## How It Works

1. User selects `.eml` file
2. JavaScript reads file as bytes
3. Passes data to WASM module
4. Go parses email (MIME multipart, base64, quoted-printable)
5. Extracts attachments and HTML body
6. Creates download links in browser

## Local Development

```bash
# Build WASM
make wasm

# Run local server
make serve

# Open http://localhost:8080
```

## Deploy

Push to `main` branch â†’ GitHub Actions builds and deploys automatically
